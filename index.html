        <h1>I AM <span>elham Mohammadi</span></h1>
        <p>After I graduated from university, I started to work in content marketing field as I heard content is the king, after that I saw if people cannot find your contents on SERP, therefore you will miss a great chance so I started to learn SEO fundamental and implemented it on some competitive keywords and I saw a dramatic increase in organic search, YES I did and that really worked. It was a thing that I wanted, get more traffic and more sales. While I was working on SEO, I started to deepen my knowledge in data analysis and improved my technical background to get a better data driven decisions and as a result, I improved online presence for many businesses globally. I personally believe beside soft skills like communication and team work, mix of Strategy, SEO, UX and Data would be ideal for all businesses, so I have eager to learn new things related to my field as I believe learning is Power.
